_Caesar Cipher_

A simple implementation of the Caesar Cipher encryption algorithm in Python.

_Description_

The Caesar Cipher is a basic encryption technique where each letter in the plaintext is shifted by a fixed number of positions down the alphabet.

_Features_

- Encrypts and decrypts messages using the Caesar Cipher algorithm
- Allows user to input the message and shift value
- Preserves case and non-alphabetical characters

_Usage_

1. Run the script using Python
2. Enter the message to encrypt or decrypt
3. Enter the shift value (integer)
